- [ ] Research load cell amplifier alternatives (HX711 vs ADS1232)
- [ ] Create **prototype wiring diagram** (Fritzing or similar)
- [ ] Order remaining components (NFC module, jumper wires, breadboard, power supply)
- [ ] Update requirements specification document

### Deliverables
- [Hardware Setup Phase 1](../docs/hardware-setup.png)
- [Wiring diagrams](../docs/wiring-diagram.png)
- [Requirements specification document v2](../docs/requirements-specification-v2.pdf)

---

## **Week 5 – Hardware Assembly & Phase 1 Implementation**
### Objectives
- Build basic weight measurement system
- Achieve core functionality

### Tasks
- [ ] Assemble **Load Cell + HX711 + ESP32 display**
- [ ] Write basic code to:
   - [ ] Initialize HX711
   - [ ] Calibrate load cell
   - [ ] Show weight on ESP32 display
- [ ] Test accuracy with known weights
- [ ] Debug and document setup in GitHub Wiki

### Deliverables
- Working load cell measurement system
- Calibration procedures
- [Basic firmware code](../smar-inventory-pallete-phase-1/)
- Documentation in GitHub Wiki

---

## **Week 6 – NFC Integration**
### Objectives
- Integrate NFC vehicle identification system
- Test multi-vehicle recognition

### Tasks
- [ ] Connect NFC module to ESP32
- [ ] Write code to:
   - [ ] Read NFC card/tag UID
   - [ ] Display vehicle ID on screen
- [ ] Link vehicle IDs with **test database** on SaaS platform
- [ ] Test multiple vehicle tags for recognition

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Component delivery delays | High | Order components early, have backup suppliers |
| NFC integration complexity | Medium | Allocate extra time in Week 6, research alternatives |
| Cloud connectivity issues | Medium | Test with local server first, implement offline storage |
| Hardware compatibility | High | Thorough research in Week 4, test immediately upon receipt |
